[Telco Customer Churn - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)  
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
### Overview - The Quick Pitch  
Companies that are subscription based, such as gyms, streaming services, and even certain apparel companies are highly interested in retaining their customers as this is how they generate revenue.  Churn is known when a customer decides to cancel their subscription based on a variety of factors.  Telco, a communications company, wants to first understand what factors contribute to a customer decision to leave as well as predict customer churn.  
### The Problem  
What factors are driving our customers to churn?  
How can we predict customer churn before it happens?  
Losing customers due to churn can negatively impact revenue.  
### The Solution  
We explored patterns in the dataset regarding customer churn.  
We then estimated the propensity that a customer would churn in the near future, identified the factors that contributed to the customerâ€™s decision to terminate their contract, and proactively reached out to the customer to enhance their experience to prevent churn. This will help reduce costly deals and plans that are offered to customers to keep their contract.  
### Highlights  
Some of the key attributes that contributed to customer churn are: less time with the company (smaller tenure), contract type, and the type of internet.  
### Resources Used  
R Studio: a programming language for statistical computing and graphics  
Algorithms : Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes
